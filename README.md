# TinyDash theme for Dashactyl v0.4

Just a reminder that I won't be updating this theme no matter what, because it's already public, and for a couple of reasons. You can contact me at adrea#0001 to discuss a custom enterprise theme (supporting both v1.0 and v0.4) or if you have any other requests. Do not direct message me if you want me to add features or make you a free theme.

If you like my theme, consider donating at https://ko-fi.com/adrea, I will be grateful, and I will surely create more themes, considering if they are free or paid.

Dashactyl v0.4 is EOL.
